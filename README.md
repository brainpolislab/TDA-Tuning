# TDA-Tuning
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is an advanced approach to data analysis grounded in algebraic topology. It goes beyond traditional statistics by employing topological concepts to reveal inherent shapes and structures within complex datasets. Using tools like persistent homology, TDA helps identify essential topological features, offering a formal and mathematical framework for a deeper understanding of intricate data patterns.

## Mapper Algorithm
The Mapper algorithm plays a crucial role in TDA. Rooted in algebraic topology, Mapper is designed to reveal the Underlying structure of high-dimensional data. Using a formalized process that constructs *simplicial complex*, Mapper transforms raw data into a simplified representation, preserving essential topological information. This formal approach ensures a systematic exploration of data patterns, enhancing our understanding of intrinsic shapes and connections.
